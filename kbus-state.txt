==========
Kbus State
==========

A frequent desire of Kbus users is to have some form of shared state.
The typical use case is that one Kbus entity (A) contains some 
state which entity B wishes to inspect. Should A or B crash and
restart, the state should be updated appropriately and we would 
like B to pick up changes in state as often as is convenient.

There are several ways to solve this problem but none of them are
really satisfactory - one can issue a Kbus request/reply for every
inspection of state, but this is time consuming and error-prone
in the case that many other messages are crossing the bus.

An announcement protocol will work, but there are issues with
notifying listeners when a process crashes and this involves quite
a lot of boiler-plate which must be written for each bit of state.

The solution
------------

We propose a centralised solution within kbus:

- There is an entity called a State. A State is represented by a structure::

   typedef struct state_struct
   {
     /* Kbus message id of the last applied update to this state */
     kbus_message_id last_update_id;
     ksock_id_t last_update_process;

     /* Time at which that message happened */
     struct timespec last_update_time;

     /* Incremented by 1 every time the state is updated */
     uint64_t generation;

   #define STATE_PRESENT (1<<0)
     uint32_t flags;

     ssize_t  nr_state_bytes;
     ssize_t  nr_bytes_mapped;
     uint8_t data[];
   };

- To inspect or change a state, one subscribes to the state with a call::

    mem = subscribe( Name , Nr-Bytes, Max-Update-Interval,  Read | Write | Exact );

  * ``Max-Update-Interval`` represents the maximum time that can elapse
    between a commit() and the data showing up here.
  * ``Nr-Bytes`` is the number of bytes to map.
  * ``Read | Write`` are permissions flags.
  * If ``Exact`` is specified, ``Max-Update-Interval`` must be respected -
    else, Kbus will do its best.

  ``mem`` is a pointer to mapped memory for the state in this process (that
  is, to the ``data[]`` in the state structure).

The amount of memory actually shared is the max of all the ``Nr-Bytes``
values. It is envisioned that this will typically be a page.

- To change a state, call::

    id = commit(state, bool return_to_newest);

  If the commit could not be made for some reason and ``return_to_newest``
  is true, we set the state back to the most recent published value.

  Or call::
  
    id = abort(state);

  to set the state back to the most recent value (note that this may not be
  the value that was there before you started changing it).

- It is envisioned that processes will use futexes to control
  multiple access to a state, but we provide::

    id = transact(state, &hdr)

  which marks the start of a transaction. Updates to the state from this point
  until a ``commit()`` or ``abort()`` are not made visible and if you
  subsequently call ``commit(state)`` and someone else has modified the state,
  ``commit()`` will return ABORTED.

  ``transact()`` also returns the header of the state.

- Function calls in this API may take up to ``Max-Update-Interval`` to
  complete - if the socket is nonblocking, it will become read  or writable
  when the function is complete and you can then call
  ``state_transaction_done(id..)`` to check if your transaction is finished.
  This is done to give the kbus module a better chance of computing a feasable
  schedule.

- Admission control is in effect on state attachment - if a valid message
  schedule cannot be found, ``subscribe()`` will return an error code and you
  must try again.

- The way this works underneath is "as if" each process which
  ``subscribe()``'s sends a reliable announcement (i.e. one which doesn't
  require buffer space and therefore cannot fail) at intervals such that every
  other subscriber receives state updates no less than its
  ``Max-Update-Interval`` after the state is updated.

  These state update messages are perfectly normal Kbus messages - they have
  ids, sender and receiver. They are "magic" in that they require no buffer
  space and cannot be stopped. They will, however, be delivered to any
  watching Ksock.

  The way it actually works, of course, is that each subscriber has an
  ``mmap()``'d bit of memory. When a ``commit()`` happens, that data is copied
  to the "master" copy of the state, which kbus holds as ``vmalloc()``'d
  memory (but should be accounted against every process which subscribes),
  and other subscribers are automagically updated unless they have
  transactions in progress.

  If anyone is bound normally to the state, when an update occurs, they get an
  announcement containing the state value as data.

- Transactions nest.

- Things that worry me:

  - Pointers and variably-sized state: there is no easy way to handle these
    that I can think of.
 
  - DoS attacks caused by people opening huge numbers of transactions
    (per-process limit on the nesting level + total number of transactions per
    process?)

  - If we have to do this with limpets, is it in fact possible to have a sane
    transaction schedule at all?

  - Performance with large numbers of subscribers.

Other notes:

Use copy-on-write?

NB: if state is mapped readonly, then we can use a direct mapping to KBUS's
internal state.

State limited to one page, for simplicity and speed.
